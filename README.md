# Hyperparameter_Tuning_for_Neural_Networks
  
Fine-tuning the parameters of neural networks is pivotal for their efficient training. These parameters, known as hyperparameters, are predetermined settings that shape the network's architecture and training process. They encompass variables like learning rate, batch size, layer count, neuron quantity per layer and regularization parameters.
The process of hyperparameter tuning revolves around systematically exploring various hyperparameter combinations to maximize the network's performance on a given task or dataset. It's an iterative and resource-intensive procedure, involving training multiple neural networks with diverse hyperparameter configurations and evaluating their efficacy.

We will apply several optimization algorithms — **Random Search, HyperBand, Bayesian Optimization and Optuna** — to tune the hyperparameters of a classification model for a churn dataset. Afterward, we will compare the best hyperparameters obtained from each approach to evaluate their effectiveness.
